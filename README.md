don't copy my stuff or color pick! if I don't respond I'm busy or in a call, I normally express how I feel with face expressions, I dont like texting on pt, (mainly when im on pc) but I'm not ignoring you! (also I wanna say something but by then it's too late, bc im thniking on what to say..) sorryy! i’m an awkward person so if I do not know how to reply I’ll probably be quiet.
